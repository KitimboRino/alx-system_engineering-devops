0x18. Webstack monitoring

Monitoring is essential for various reasons:

1. **Performance Optimization:** Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks, allowing for proactive optimization of system resources and configurations.

2. **Issue Detection and Resolution:** By continuously monitoring systems, anomalies and errors can be detected early, facilitating prompt resolution before they escalate into critical issues.

3. **Resource Utilization:** Monitoring provides insights into resource usage patterns, enabling efficient allocation and utilization of resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space.

4. **Security:** Monitoring helps detect and respond to security threats, including unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activities, and potential breaches.

5. **Compliance:** Many industries and organizations have regulatory requirements mandating the monitoring of systems and infrastructure to ensure compliance with security and data protection standards.

The two main areas of monitoring are:

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring:** This involves monitoring the underlying hardware and software components of an IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, storage, databases, and operating systems. Infrastructure monitoring ensures the availability, performance, and reliability of these components.

2. **Application Monitoring:** This focuses on monitoring the performance and behavior of software applications deployed within the infrastructure. Application monitoring involves tracking metrics such as response time, throughput, error rates, and resource consumption to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

Access logs for a web server like Nginx contain records of all requests made to the server, including details such as the IP address of the client, the date and time of the request, the requested URL, the HTTP status code, and other relevant information. Access logs are valuable for analyzing traffic patterns, identifying potential security threats, and troubleshooting issues related to web server performance or availability.

Error logs for a web server like Nginx contain records of errors and other abnormal events that occur during the operation of the server. These logs typically include details such as the type of error, the time it occurred, the request that triggered the error, and any additional contextual information. Error logs are crucial for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues such as server misconfigurations, application errors, and security vulnerabilities.
