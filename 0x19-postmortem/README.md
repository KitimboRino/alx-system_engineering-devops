0x19. Postmortem

postmortem, often called a "postmortem analysis" or simply "postmortem," is a process where a team reviews a completed project or a specific incident, such as a software error or system failure.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, why it happened, and how similar issues can be prevented in the future.

During a postmortem, team members discuss the sequence of events leading up to the problem, examine the root causes, identify any contributing factors, and propose solutions or preventive measures.
It's a structured approach to learning from mistakes and improving processes.

The term "postmortem" is borrowed from the medical field, where it refers to an examination of a body after death to determine the cause of death.

In software development, it's similarly about diagnosing what caused a project or system to "fail" and how to avoid similar failures in the future.
