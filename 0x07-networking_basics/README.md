OSI Model:
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It provides a systematic way to understand and design network protocols and communication processes. The model consists of seven layers, from the lowest to the highest: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

LAN (Local Area Network):
A LAN is a network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus. It is used for connecting computers and devices within close proximity, facilitating resource sharing and communication.

Typical Usage: File sharing, printer sharing, and collaborative work.
Typical Geographical Size: Within a single building or campus.
WAN (Wide Area Network):
A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, often connecting LANs across cities or even countries. It enables communication and data transfer over long distances.

Typical Usage: Connecting geographically distant offices, accessing remote resources.
Typical Geographical Size: Covers a large geographic area.
Internet:
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks. It allows for the exchange of information, resources, and services on a global scale.

IP Address:
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Two Types of IP Address:

IPv4 (32-bit address)
IPv6 (128-bit address)
Localhost:
Localhost refers to the loopback address (usually 127.0.0.1), allowing a device to communicate with itself.

Subnet:
A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, helping to efficiently manage and organize IP addresses.

IPv6 Creation:
IPv6 was created to address the depletion of IPv4 addresses, providing a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.

TCP/UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two transport layer protocols in the OSI model.

Two Mainly Used Data Transfer Protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Difference Between TCP and UDP:
TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and retransmission of lost packets. UDP is connectionless, providing faster but less reliable communication without error recovery.

Port:
A port is a logical endpoint for communication, allowing multiple applications on the same device to use network resources simultaneously.

SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers:

SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443
Tool/Protocol for Checking Network Connectivity:
Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network. It sends a test message to a specified IP address and waits for a response.
